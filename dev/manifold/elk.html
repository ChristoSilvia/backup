  <title>Carrying Capacity of Elk</title>
<head>

<body>
Familiarize yourself with <a href="oned-systems.html">one dimensional dynamical systems</a>.

When observing ecosystems, we see that the population usually doesn't increase past a certain <a href="carrying-capacity.html">carrying capacity</a>.  We want to design a one-dimensional dynamical model with these characteristics,
which we observe in nature.

Design a model for elk population with the following characteristics:

<ol>
  <li>When the population is small (much less than the carrying capacity), population increases exponentially.</li>
  <li>Population always increases when below the carrying capacity, and decreases when above the carrying capacity.</li>
  <li>The carrying capacity is 10000 individuals</li>
</ol>
