Landing rockets is difficult, as evinced by the recent failures and 
	celebrated successes of SpaceX in landing an orbital first stage.
It is also a necessary part of a cost-effective re-usable rocket system.
The primary role of the first stage of an orbital rocket is to give as much
	speed and altitude as possible to the second stage, so that it can achieve
	orbit.
The first stage is therefore traveling extremely fast after releasing the second stage,
	so fast that experiments with parachute recovery have all ended in failure.
SpaceX and Blue Origin have recently tried a new approach:
	they use the rocket engines already on board the second stage to slow the
	rocket down for a soft landing.

If one is trying to land a rocket, one must first apply thrust to cancel out 
	any horizontal velocity with respect to the surface one is landing on.
Then, one needs to orient the rocket with its engine facing downwards, in the same
	position that it launched in, except moving the opposite direction.
Finally, one must fire the engines in order to slow down the rocket, so that
	it comes to a stop just as its landing legs begin to touch the ground.

One strategy for landing rockets is to wait as long as possible to fire the
	engines, firing them at the last possible moment and at full thrust.
This method, known as a ``suicide burn'' uses the least fuel, although it 
	is difficult to control for errors, since there is a very small margin for error.
It can be necessary since it is difficult to design rocket engines which
	can throttle to less than half of their maximum thrust, and therefore 
	many rockets (such as SpaceX's
	Falcon 9) are unable to hover, because they can't apply 
	a \emph{small} enough force.
In this case, a suicide burn is the only option.

I will discuss techniques for planning suicide burns for two scenarios.
In both scenarios, the gravity is assumed to be of constant strength.
This is a valid approximation when close to the surface of a planet.
Since our rockets typically fire below 10km altitude for earth landings,
	we can safely use this approximation, which greatly simplifies
	calculations because the gravitational acceleration is now constant.
In the first scenario, the rocket applies a set force to itself with the engine,
	and its mass is fixed (i.e., no propellant is consumed).
This approximation is valid for slow landings, or landings which do not 
	consume an appreciable fraction of the mass of the entire rocket
	in fuel.
The second scenario takes into account the use of the fuel, and is therefore
	valid for faster landings.
I will discuss the differences between the predictions of the two models.
For each model, I will discuss how to determine the altitude at which
	to begin the deceleration burn.
