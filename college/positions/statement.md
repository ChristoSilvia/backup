My name is Chris Silvia and I'm a math major at Cornell University.
I'm not just a math major because math is practical; I'm a math major 
	because I enjoy learning and discovering ideas.
I've taken courses on linear algebra, nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory,
	quantum physics, and special relativity.
I also buy textbooks, read them, and do the exercies.
It's fun and I get to learn and make new models on my own.
I've learned Einstein's theory of gravity, differential equations,
	and machine learning this way.
	
Since high school, I've been taking math and physics classes at the same time.
I enjoy learning math from physics classes, because physicists only 
	use as much math as they need.
At first, I was learning about calculus while seeing the questions about 
	ballistics it was developed to answer.
Then, I was learning about electricity and magnetism, and the vector calculus 
	that was developed entirely to describe these force fields.
I've consistently learned that math is created to describe the world.
I want to create the most elegant descriptions of everything I see.
This is often a matter of knowing what to leave out.
For example, if I want to determine the trajectory of a cannon-ball,
	my first model is going to leave out any details about the cannon-ball
	except its mass.
My second model might contain a brief description of how drag slows the cannonball
	down.
I start with simplicity, and then only add complexity when I need to add it.
